A convenient way for clients, future employers, and co-workers to get more insight about myself, beyond the resume."},{"id":2,"title":"Process","information":"I wanted to create a brand design that I can have fun with and animate while expressing an explosive impact. It was unnecessary to use a robust backend to support a site that would consist of static content so I sought to find static site tooling that I can easily maintain. I also wanted to work with React and found React Static by Nozzle which made the adoption of React very seamless, as it used React and Webpack, which I was already implementing in my front-end workflow. I created a responsive logo and wordmark that I may use for print and web to promote the brand and platform, as well deliver a consistent and professional look, that conveyed my eagerness to get started on working on projects and the impact that I can make. I utilized SVG Animation to animate the logo and supporting assets on the site with responsive design in mind. I was able to tap into the core features of React to seamlessly implement the front end of the site and add my created assets."}]},{"sectionid":2,"sectiontitle":"Brand","subsections":[{"id":1,"title":"Logo Design","images":[{"imageid":1,"imagetype":"behance","image":"LOGO_DESIGN.png","imagetitle":"Logo Design","imagecaption":"Logo Design used by BoomTech Brand","imageformat":"png"}]},{"id":2,"title":"Wordmark","images":[{"imageid":1,"imagetype":"behance","image":"WORDMARK.png","imagetitle":"Wordmark","imagecaption":"Boom Tech Wordmark","imageformat":"png"}]},{"id":3,"title":"Color Scheme","images":[{"imageid":1,"imagetype":"behance","image":"COLOR_SCHEME.png","imagetitle":"Color Scheme","imagecaption":"Color Scheme for BoomTech Brand","imageformat":"png"}]},{"id":4,"title":"Typography","images":[{"imageid":1,"imagetype":"behance","image":"bt_typography.png","imagetitle":"Typography","imagecaption":"Typography used by BoomTech Brand","imageformat":"png"}]},{"id":5,"title":"Marketing","images":[{"imageid":1,"imagetype":"behance","image":"MARKETING.png","imagetitle":"Marketing","imagecaption":"Marketing material used by BoomTech Brand","imageformat":"png"}]},{"id":6,"title":"Marketing 2","images":[{"imageid":1,"imagetype":"behance","image":"MARKETING_2.png","imagetitle":"More Marketing Material","imagecaption":"Marketing Material used by BoomTech Brand","imageformat":"png"}]},{"id":7,"title":"Display Use","images":[{"imageid":1,"imagetype":"behance","image":"DISPLAY.png","imagetitle":"Typography","imagecaption":"Signage used by BoomTech Brand","imageformat":"png"}]}]},{"sectionid":3,"sectiontitle":"Web","subsections":[{"id":1,"title":"Desktop and Mobile","images":[{"imageid":1,"imagetype":"behance","image":"WEB.png","imagetitle":"Boomtech Home Page","imagecaption":"Boomtech home page on Desktop and Mobile","imageformat":"png"}]}]}]}}
